# faa-mammographic

### Objective

The main goal of this project is to apply suitable machine learning algorithms learned in class to solve a specific data science problem, in this case, models capable of identifying benign or malignant masses in mammographyâ€™s. In this report, we try to obtain the best result of the accuracy of the implemented models.

### Requirements
The project was developed using the conda environment, so there is no file requirements.txt, but the libraries used were:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- seaborn
- sklearn

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Mammographic Mass Data Set, which can be found at the following [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass) and is available [here](./dataset/) in the repository too.

### Machine Learning Process

The machine learning process was divided into 4 steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Data Visualization
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation

All the code can be found [here](./src/main.ipynb) in the Jupiter Notebook.

### Report

The report of the project can be found [here](./faa_mamographic_report.pdf). The report was made in LaTeX and the source code can be found [here](./latex_files/) as well.
